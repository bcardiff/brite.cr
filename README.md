# Brite Site II


## A Little History

Back in the days when I was in the deeps of Ruby development, I create an early
static site/blog engine called Brite. It was unique in a number of ways. ...

Fast forward to 2016 and Jekyll has failed me for the last time! I tried a number of
alternates: Hugo written in Go, Obelisk in Elixir and Cryogen written in Clojure. 
Hugo seemed promising, but it soon giving me fits. Themes are a bad shape and it is 
difficult to extend. Obelisk showed promise, but it had not themes at all. You get 
blank page. It just wasn't far enough alopng. Of the three Cryogen worked the best.
With only a little conjoling I was able to get my site up. And I was about a stones
throw from going with it. After all I've always had a soft spot for Lisp. But there
was this nagging in the back of mind that I could not quite. "They are doing it wrong."
